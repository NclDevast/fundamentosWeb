            <h2> Mimi's Delivery Service</h2>
            <p class="lyrics">
                Why do I have to stay here on the ground? It's overrated<br>
                The cityscape escapes you with a sound, it's delineated<br>
                I waited at the station for an hour, but I won't make it<br>
                You take off on an updraft by the tower and you overtake it<br>
                Every moon that I see you on the rise<br>
                You're drawn across the sky<br>
                Now that ink has dried<br>
                And I can't tell you why<br>
                Oh, Mimi, can you tell me there's an issue?<br>
                I've seen it clouded all around you<br>
                I hear you tell me there's an issue you've seen before<br>
                Oh, Mimi, can you tell me there's an issue?<br>
                I've seen it clouded all around you<br>
                I hear you tell me there's an issue you've seen before<br>
                And I can't tell you why, no, I can't tell you why<br>
                Why do you have to stay here on the ground? It's overrated<br>
                The cityscape berates you with a sound, it's delineated<br>
